## Auto Assign 📝

A simple Flet app that automatically sets your favorite default apps 
(like browser, PDF reader, media player) so you don’t have to mess with 
Windows settings all the time. It saves *(at least me)* the hassle and keeps your defaults 
just how you want them. 👍

## How?

•  Download the latest release,

•  Run AutoAssign.exe

Keep AutoAssignHelper.exe in the same directory
